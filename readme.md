**Reflection**

This training helped identify how assets weave together into a Rails app and as well as some of the structure I need to be aware of. It makes a lot of sense especially after the lecture but, as always, walking through it to see the steps is really important in solidifying the concepts. I now has a good reference point in how I need to structure and order my assets so my content displays in the way it's intended. It was fun! 

**Objective:** Practice requiring CSS and JavaScript files in the Rails asset pipeline and precompiling assets.

**Terms:**

* Manifest
* Precompilation
* Concatenation
* Compression / Minification
* Browser Caching
* MD5 fingerprint

## Ode to the Asset Pipeline

Your goal is to reconstruct a simple poem. To get started:

* Clone this repo, and take any steps necessary to get the app running on your computer.
  * Note that this Rails app doesn't have a database.
* Start your server, and navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser. You should see a jumbled poem.

The poem should eventually look like this when you're done making changes:

#### Rules

* You are not allowed to modify any files *except* `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`, `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`, and `config/environments/development.rb` (to configure asset precompilation).
* Try not to use `require_tree .` anywhere.

#### Using the Asset Pipeline

The assets you need require will live somewhere in the following locations, inside of your Rails application directory:

```
app/                   # application specific code
  assets/
    images/
    javascripts/
    stylesheets/
lib/                   # custom libraries
  assets/
    javascripts/
    stylesheets/
vendor/                # third party libraries
  assets/
    javascripts/
    stylesheets/
```

Each directory has a specific use case. The files you want are scattered across them. **Your goal is to find all the files and require them in the correct order!**

A solution is in the [solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-30/asset_pipeline_poem/tree/solution).

## Bonus: Using Third-Party Code

1. Note that the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries are included in `views/layouts/application.html.erb` using CDN links. Practice requiring the files through the asset pipeline instead:

  * Find and copy the current `bootstrap.css` URL (see `views/layouts/application.html.erb`).
  * From the Terminal, run `curl -vs BOOTSTRAP_CSS_URL_YOU_COPIED > vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.min.css`
  * Finally, delete the CDN link from `application.html.erb`, and `require` the new Bootstrap CSS file in your `application.css` manifest.
  * Repeat these steps for the Bootstrap JavaScript library.
  * Precompile your assets.


 > You can also use the front-end package manager Bower to download and install library files.

2. Downloading the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files isn't the only way to use Bootstrap with the Rails asset pipeline! You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass" target="_blank">bootstrap-sass gem</a>.  
  * In `application.css` and `application.js`, remove the `require` statements for Bootstrap, and use the bootstrap-sass gem instead (follow the <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#a-ruby-on-rails" target="_blank">installation steps</a> in the docs).
  * After installing bootstrap-sass, precompile your assets again.


 > It's often easier to use a well-documented gem than to to work directly with the asset pipeline. Watch out for gems that haven't been updated in a while, though, or for bad interactions among gems.

 A solution for this bonus is in the [solution_bootstrap_sass branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-30/asset_pipeline_poem/tree/solution_bootstrap_sass).
